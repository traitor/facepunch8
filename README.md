Facepunch8
==========

Here's the code to Facepunch8. It's pretty ugly code, my excuse is that I was learning Windows Phone as I went :P


Facepunch8 uses the following frameworks:

* [CodeKicker.BBCode](https://bbcode.codeplex.com/) (heavily modified version to work with WP8, could use any library that provides similar functionality though)
* [CaledosLab.Portable.Logging](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/A-logging-solution-for-c407d880)
* [JeffWilcox.PhoneThemeManager](https://github.com/jeffwilcox/wp-thememanager)
* [Newtonsoft.Json](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
